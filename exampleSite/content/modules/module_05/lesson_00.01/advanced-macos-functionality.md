title: Advanced macOS functionality
isPublicLesson: false
---

So far we have covered all the basic stuff that you need to release an app, so we will now focus on adding more advanced features. This will require a deeper dive into both React Native internals and macOS APIs.

In this module we will cover four advanced features:

- driving **multiple windows** (while re-using a single bridge instance)

- **auto-launching** our app on system start (also taking a look at Swift packages)

- sending local **notifications** (emitting and responding to events)

- implementing **drag and drop** at OS level

Unlike the previous modules, here you can pretty much jump to whichever topic you like. As well as being a guide to the obvious functionality, each lesson contains a lot of tacit knowledge of APIs and internal functionality which should enable you to create even more novel functionality.
