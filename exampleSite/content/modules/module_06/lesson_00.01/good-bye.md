And that is it for our course! First and foremost I would like to thank you for taking part in this class, and also thank Nate and the wonderful people of newline.

We have covered a lot of ground in the use of React Native for macOS and in creating truly native experiences. It's an amazing technology and I expect with time all the small quirks and missing functionalities will be patched.

I would love to see what you are able to do with the knowledge you've acquired in the course, whether you use some of these lessons as the basis to publish your own open-source library or to create some apps (image converter! file uploader! **wink wink**).

On the next page you will find further resources, links to documentation and useful libraries.

Don't forget to [follow me](https://twitter.com/ospfranco) and newline for more courses and tooling.
